# Polygonz
Create a Polygon that has a specific area

blob_test.py just shows a wiggly blob that has a constant area :D (the line are the normals)

area_final.py is an interactive demo :)
You can add vertices of a polygon by clicking in a counterclockwise fashion.
Press space to scale the polygon to the target area (specified in area_final.py line 35).
Press 'c' to clear all vertices.
Press 'f' to quit (and pay respects).

Language: Python
